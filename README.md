# Learn Programming

A quick repo that runs through the basics of programming for beginners (I.e., no pre-requisite knowledge is assumed)

This will be done in Python since that's the most beginner-friendly language in my opinion and go through the following concepts:
1. Variables and Datatypes
2. Conditionals
3. Loops
4. Functions
5. Data Structures
  1. Arrays
  2. Dictionaries

The general hope is that this will set up the reader to be able to at least understand online tutorials for further self-study, and be able to understand basic coding terminologies.

# Content

## Milestone 1 - Basics

Concepts:
1. Printing to Stdin (Formatted + Normal)
2. Comments
3. Datatypes (`int`, `float`, `string`) and Variables
  - Operations on various Datatypes
  - Datatype conversion

Exercise:
Given two numbers, print the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo on the two numbers.

## Milestone 2 - Conditionals

Concepts:
1. Boolean Datatypes
2. If, else if and else statements

Exercise:
Given two numbers, and a particular operation, print only the result of that operation on the two numbers.

## Milestone 3 - Loops

Concepts:
1. For loops
2. While loops

Exercise:
Given a number $x$, print all numbers from 1 to $x$ which are divisible by 2.

## Milestone 4 - Basic Data Structures

Concepts:
1. List datatypes (Arrays)
2. Dictionaries

Exercise:
Given a list of Integers $A$, and a dictionary mapping Strings to Characters, print the resultant string of characters mapped to by the dictionary.

## Milestone 5 - Functions

Concepts:
1. Functions

Exercise:
Convert each of the above exercises into that of a function

## Milestone 6 - Imports

Concepts:
1. Libraries
2. Importing code

Exercise:
Import each of the other functions into a separate file
